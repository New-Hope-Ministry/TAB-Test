               licenses publishers to reproduce it under letters patent. In England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the
               letters patent are held by the King's Printer; in Scotland, they are held by the Scottish Bible Board.
               The office of the King's Printer has been associated with the right to reproduce the Bible for centuries,
               the earliest known reference coming in 1577.
